              This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
            
              To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
               1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
               2. The Docker daemon pulled the 'hello-world' image from the Docker Hub.
                  (amd64)
               3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
                  executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
               4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
                  to your terminal.

For instance, when you run the `hello-world` container twice, Docker downloads the image once and creates multiple containers from the same image. But where do these images come from?
